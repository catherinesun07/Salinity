For starting with the GP model, it is standard in sequential experimental design: start with a small, space‑filling seed set, train a GP, then place additional sensors where predicted. 
- For now I am just starting wtih an evenly spaced grid of points. I'm not sure how many points to choose, maybe set that as a preliminary parameter.
